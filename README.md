# About me
_**Information about me and some stuff I work on**_

My name is Dr. William "Amos" Confer.  I'm a [computer science][csdept] professor at the [State University of New York Polytechnic Institute][sunypi] and formerly a managing Staff Engineer at Samsung Mobile working with the Advanced Projects team and leading the Mobile Network Operators
Engineering Patent group.

## Why does this project exist?

I never maintain my own web page... I regularly replace it with something I want to get to my students or colleagues.
One month it could be an interactive web app demonstrating a generative logo idea.
One month it might be a take home exam.
The next two months it might be a programming competition write up.
I just don't feel like maintaining a traditional page... so here this is :-)

## Selected recent projects

### MiniAT
My primary work right now is the [MiniAT Virtual Embedded Architecture][miniat] project, recently rewriting the assembler from scratch to provide a novel style assembly language grammar for the MiniAT, easily read and written by even entry-level assembly programmers.

### Exploring SE for Android

Co-authored the book, "[Exploring SE for Android][android]", with William Roberts (former lead engineer of the Samsung KNOX security product and long-time SE for Android team member).
The book is the first written resource anywhere to walk through the entire process of getting an enforcing-mode SE for Android system up and running on a device on which SE for Android has never run before.
Historically, this is the purview of OEMs, such as Samsung, and requires the engineer to reconcile the technical differences between four open source products with unique goals and release schedules; namely Android, the Linux kernel, SELinux and SE for Android.
This book frankly demonstrates how complicated the process can be and how issues can/must be discovered and overcome.

### Tasty numbers

Tasty numbers are a class of numbers I discovered accidentally one day at lunch.
I have a number of proofs and conjectures about these numbers in different bases, but am currently
working on an initial publication introducing them, so I will not say more about them here for the moment.

### "Flat" programming competitions

Inspired by issues with notable programming competition formats (e.g., ACM's programming competition),
I've devised a new programming competition format that levels the field of entry to include/intrigue beginning and expert programmers equally (even non-programmers could compete) and awards iterative solution improvement.

## Selected interesting past projects

### Generative Design book

Reviewed and assisted with technical translation for the English language translation of the award winning German text, [Gernerative Gestaltung][gen_gestaltung], by Hartmut Bohnacker, Benedikt Gro√ü, and Julia Laub.

### Activity-based character recognition
An accurate and extremely low resource on-line character recognition system (US patent acquired).

### MVPP
The development of the Minimally Viable Product Process, an iterative return on investment based software process for dislocated and/or complexly scheduled teams.

### CAP
The development of Collaborative Adversarial Pair (CAP) programming to maximize the efficiency of pair/group feature engineering while otherwise benefiting from the traditional gains of pair programming.
